# snipponents

Not quite a component, but more than a snippet.

##snippet
###/ˈsnipit/
>a small piece or brief extract.

##com·po·nent
###/kəmˈpōnənt/
>constituting part of a larger whole; constituent.

A collection of code I've written that others might find helpful, but that I don't think warrant creating a plugin/repo/addon/gem/component/package/whatever.

Broken down by framework, or more broadly language, where applicable.
